  <h2>Plot Summary</h2>
  <p>
    "Inception" is a mind-bending sci-fi thriller directed by Christopher Nolan.
    The story follows Dom Cobb, a skilled thief who steals secrets from deep
    within the subconscious during the dream state. Cobb is offered a chance
    to have his past crimes erased if he can implant an idea into someone’s mind —
    a process known as inception.
